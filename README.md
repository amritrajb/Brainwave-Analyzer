# Brainwave-Analyzer
## Introduction
A simple parser in Python to visualize the brainwave data collected from [NeuroSky Mindwave Mobile EEG Headset](http://neurosky.com/biosensors/eeg-sensor/biosensors/). This was originally develped as part of trying to explore whether it possible to  quantify the calmness induced by difference music stimulus throught brainwaves - Delta, Theta, Alpha, Beta and Gamma. However, the visualizer and spectogram plotter may be useful in other domains as well.
# Usage
```
python brainview.py <input-file>
```
